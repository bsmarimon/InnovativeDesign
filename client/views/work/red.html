          <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Red Tier is UC Berkeleyâ€™s premiere exclusive student driven tier nested in the
          midst of the largest ASUC sponsored design club on all of campus. Our red tier
          members have experience in both projected simulcasts and real world solutionmaking.
          Red tier promotes growth and exploration among members as well as
          dedication and social motivation. We emphasize contemporary values over
          dated and pedantic traditionalistic views, as we are always in the forefront of
          novel applications in the UC Berkeley community. Over the course of its history,
          red tier has developed and grown to become a renowned organization that
          others use as an example for Berkeley leadership and ideals.</p>

          <p>In the words of our founder:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>It is not the person who becomes the master of trades, but the
          entrepreneurial spirit that drives the impetus of creation and due
          process of all mankind.</p>
